# HydraWall-x-


The Problem: Standard security only catches "known" threats. If an attack is brand new (Zero-Day), it walks right in.

Our Solution: HydraWall-X doesn't wait for a "Wanted" poster. It learns your computer's healthy "heartbeat" using AI and kernel-level sensors (eBPF). If a process starts acting weird, even if it's a never-before-seen hack,our system flags it instantly.

Why it works: It catches the behavior of a hacker, not just their files. No signatures, no delays, just proactive protection.
